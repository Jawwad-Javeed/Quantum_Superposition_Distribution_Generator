## ðŸ“˜ Project Purpose

The ability to specify Quantum Superposition Distributions (P(|0>) and P(|1>)) of a Qubit is effective for representing multiple complex states, an important attribute of Quantum computing that allows it to perform certain calculations more efficiently than a classical computer.

Currently however, it is difficult to specify a given probability distribution; for example, if the set distribution of P(|0>) and P(|1>) is selected to be 74%-26%,it would require trial and error in order to achieve the specific controlled rotation that would result in this Quantum Superposition Distribution(A demonstration of why simply entering a controlled rotation of a given percentage about a non-eigenstate axis would not work is available at [`Juypter_Notebook_Quantum_Superposition_Distribution_Generator_Demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/Jawwad-Javeed/Quantum_Superposition_Distribution_Generator/blob/main/Juypter_Notebook_Quantum_Superposition_Distribution_Generator/Juypter_Notebook_Quantum_Superposition_Distribution_Generator_Demo.ipynb))

This project aims to resolve this problem by using different Polynomial equations in order to predict the controlled rotations required for the specified Quantum Superposition Distribution.

## ðŸ“„ About

Qiskit Program that can generate a specified Quantum Superposition distribution (P(|0>) and P(|1>)) by utilizing Polynomial equations.

For this project it is recommended to use one of IBM's Quantum computers instead of a simulator in order to generate truly random numbers, however for testing purposes the [QASM Simulator](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator.html#qasmsimulator) is the most accurate and similar to a real-life Quantum Simulator and is used as a proof of concept.


## ðŸ’» Required Environment Installations

$ pip install Qiskit
